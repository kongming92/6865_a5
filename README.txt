How long did the assignment take?
{A1: about 8 hours}
Potential issues with your solution and explanation of partial completion (for partial credit)
{A2: My ante2 with bilateral doesn't look exactly like the PDF (blacks look darker), but it was said to be okay in office hours. I'm fairly sure I implemented both makeHDR and tonemap as specified though, and the other images look fine.}
Any extra credit you may have implemented
{A3: none}
Collaboration acknowledgement (but again, you must write your own code)
{A4: Ryan Lacey}
What was most unclear/difficult?
{A5: some of the numpy operations, especially in trying to filter out the 0 elements}
What was most exciting?
{A6: getting HDR to work and seeing good images!}
